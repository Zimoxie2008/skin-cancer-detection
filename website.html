<section>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Our project focuses on using artificial intelligence to detect skin cancer more quickly, accurately, and affordably. By training models with realistic skin images and using techniques like data augmentation and model optimisation, we aim to improve early detection, reduce unnecessary hospital visits, and make screenings more accessible, especially in underserved areas.</p>

    <h2>Experimental Log</h2>
    
    <div class="log-entry">
        <h3>Part 1: Effect of Augmentation on Model Accuracy</h3>
        <p>We started by testing how different augmentations (such as changing brightness or zooming in on images) affect the model's accuracy. Initial results showed that augmentations improved the model's ability to recognize skin lesions under varying conditions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="log-entry">
        <h3>Part 2: Model Optimisation</h3>
        <p>Next, we explored various optimisation techniques, such as adjusting learning rates, using different optimisers like AdamW and RAdam, and adding regularisation methods like dropout. These changes helped improve model stability and training time.</p>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Support and Resources</h2>
    <p>We received support from Dr. Albrecht in understanding model optimisation. We sourced our dataset from a publicly available skin lesion database, though we plan to gather more varied images to simulate real-world conditions.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>One of the challenges we faced was ensuring the model performs well with diverse, real-world images. We also had to understand complex machine learning techniques to fine-tune the model and manage computational resources effectively.</p>
